## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline**, including:
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Web application development
- Cloud deployment with monitoring

The application runs entirely on the server and does **not depend on the local machine**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build and deploy a sentiment analysis system that:
- Processes real-world e-commerce product reviews
- Performs text preprocessing and sentiment prediction
- Serves predictions through a user-friendly web interface
- Operates continuously using cloud infrastructure

## 🚀 Deployment (AWS EC2 + Streamlit)

### Deployment Environment

- **EC2 Instance Type:** t3.micro
- **Region:** ap-south-2
- **Inbound Ports Enabled:**
  - SSH – `22`
  - Streamlit – `8501`

### Deployment Steps

1. Launched an EC2 instance with Ubuntu 22.04
2. Configured security groups to allow SSH and Streamlit access
3. Cloned the GitHub repository onto the EC2 instance
4. Created and activated a Python virtual environment
5. Installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`
6. Configured the Streamlit app to load trained ML models
7. Deployed the application as a **systemd service** to ensure:
   - Automatic restart on failure
   - Auto-start on server reboot
   - Continuous availability (24/7)

---

## 🧪 Testing and Monitoring

### Testing
- ✅ Verified public accessibility using EC2 public IP
- ✅ Tested predictions using positive, negative, and edge-case reviews
- ✅ Restarted the service to validate recovery
- ✅ Rebooted the EC2 instance to confirm auto-start functionality

### Monitoring

**Service health:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status flipkart-streamlit
```

**Application logs:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u flipkart-streamlit -f
```

**System resources:**
```bash
top
df -h
```

The application is configured with automatic restart to ensure high availability.

---

## ✅ Production Highlights

- ✨ End-to-end ML pipeline (training → inference → deployment)
- ☁️ Cloud-hosted and laptop-independent
- 🔄 Auto-restart and reboot-safe deployment
- 🌐 Real-world deployment using AWS and systemd

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The model was trained using **scikit-learn 1.5.1** and served using **scikit-learn 1.3.x**
- Version mismatch generates warnings only; inference remains stable
- The application runs fully on the server and does not depend on the local machine

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add multi-class sentiment classification
- [ ] Store predictions in a database
- [ ] Integrate CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement model versioning
- [ ] Add user authentication
